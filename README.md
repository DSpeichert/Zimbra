#Zimbra Collaboration Server API classes for PHP

This is a set of classes you can use to communicate with the Soap API of a Zimbra ZCS server. For the moment there is no written documentation available but general usage should be easy to understand through looking at the classes.

## Installation

This library is a PSR-O compatible library which means any PSR-O compliant autoloader will be able to load and use these classes by just registering the namespace.

You can also use composer since this library is available as a package from http://packagist.org/packages/nucleusbe/zimbra. This is the preferred way of using these Zimbra classes.

##License
This library is released under the [GPLv3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) and is a work derived from [Libersoft's zcs-php library](https://github.com/libersoft/zcs-php).
