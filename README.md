#Zimbra Collaboration Server API classes for PHP

This is a set of classes you can use to communicate with the Soap API of a Zimbra ZCS server. For the moment there is no written documentation available but general usage should be easy to understand through looking at the classes.

## Installations

This library is a PSR-O compatible library which means any PSR-O compliant autoloader will be able to load and use these classes by just registering the namespace.

You can also use composer since this library is available as a package from http://packagist.org/packages/nucleusbe/zimbra

##License
This library is released under the GPLv3 license and is a work derived from Libersoft's zcs-php library.
